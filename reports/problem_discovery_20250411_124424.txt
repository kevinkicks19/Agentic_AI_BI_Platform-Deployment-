PROBLEM SUMMARY
--------------
Problem Statement: The e-commerce platform in the technology industry is facing high cart abandonment rates despite implementing changes related to unexpected shipping costs and a complex checkout process.
Key Challenges: {'1': 'Identifying additional factors contributing to cart abandonment beyond shipping costs and checkout process complexity.', '2': 'Improving data analysis to understand customer behavior and reasons for cart abandonment more comprehensively.', '3': 'Effectively aligning stakeholders and conveying the urgency and impact of addressing cart abandonment.', '4': 'Addressing resource constraints including limited availability of specialized expertise and budget constraints.'}
Business Impact: The high cart abandonment rates are impacting conversion rates, revenue generation, customer retention, and overall performance of the e-commerce platform.
Stakeholders: {'Internal': ['E-commerce manager', 'Team handling platform optimization'], 'External': ['Customers']}
Constraints: {'1': 'Limited resources for implementing and testing new strategies.', '2': 'Resistance to change from key stakeholders accustomed to the current setup.'}
Desired Outcomes: {'1': 'Reduce cart abandonment rates through targeted strategies based on comprehensive data analysis.', '2': 'Optimize the platform to improve customer experience, increase sales, and enhance customer retention.', '3': 'Implement cost-effective solutions without significant additional investments or hiring new team members.'}
