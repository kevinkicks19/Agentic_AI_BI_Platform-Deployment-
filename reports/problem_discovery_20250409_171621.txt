PROBLEM SUMMARY
--------------
Problem Statement: The e-commerce platform in the technology industry is experiencing high cart abandonment rates, impacting sales despite optimization efforts.
Key Challenges: {'1': 'Pinpointing specific reasons behind high abandonment rates despite tracking metrics like overall abandonment rate, stages of abandonment, and devices used.', '2': 'Limited use of advanced data analysis methods like cohort analysis or funnel visualization to gain deeper insights.', '3': 'Coordination and alignment among key stakeholders (marketing, web development, customer service, data analysts) with differing priorities and perspectives.', '4': 'Urgency in implementing solutions within a tight timeline while facing constraints in resources and technical capabilities.'}
Business Impact: Decreased conversion rates and revenue due to a poor user experience and inefficient checkout process resulting from high cart abandonment rates.
Stakeholders: ['Marketing Team', 'Web Development Team', 'Customer Service Representatives', 'Data Analysts']
Constraints: {'1': 'Limited resources and technical capabilities for more complex technical implementations and in-depth analysis.', '2': 'Existing team stretched thin with other projects, making it challenging to dedicate time and manpower for optimization efforts.'}
Desired Outcomes: {'1': 'Increase conversion rates and overall revenue by improving user experience, streamlining the checkout process, and reducing cart abandonment rates.', '2': 'Facilitate effective communication, collaboration, and alignment among stakeholders to address the issue efficiently.'}
